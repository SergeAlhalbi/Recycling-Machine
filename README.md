Recycling Machine Design

From the beginning, we have been concerned with understanding the pollution problem and finding a way to reduce its harsh effects on all living things. As a solution to this problem, we have tasked ourselves with designing a small-scale plastic recycling machine.

We began by introducing the problem and its various aspects, and then we conducted research on the origins of plastics and their human applications. Following that, we discussed the various types of machines that are available for plastic recycling. Most importantly, we narrowed our ideas and thoughts from the big picture to select a specific area of study in this process, which became the shredding one.

Following that, we used our knowledge to design and simulate our machine. As a result, in order to improve our shredding mechanism and reduce errors, we needed to investigate all aspects of our machine; for example, the friction factor could be introduced and studied in the calculation section. Furthermore, numerous design factors that undoubtedly affect efficiency, such as the number of blades and shafts, the geometry of the blade, the gear parameters, and the distance between the rotating shafts, could be investigated.

To conclude, we anticipate that we have accomplished our primary goal, which is to raise awareness of the environmental importance of recycling. Before we throw anything away, consider reusing it. We discovered through our paper that recycling plastics is not as simple as it appears. It does present some real challenges, but recycling has a low cost in terms of its benefits.
